        <li><b>What is html?</b></li>
        <p><b>HTML</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.It defines the content and structure
        of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
        <li><b>What is difference b/w html & xhtml?</b></li>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) are both markup languages used for creating web pages,
           but they differ primarily in their syntax strictness and underlying foundations.
        </p>
        <li><b>What is tag?</b></li>
        <p>HTML tags are the fundamental building blocks of web development, providing the structure and organization necessary for creating web 
        pages. They are special words or characters enclosed in angle brackets < > that define the type of content on a web page and instruct web 
        browsers on how to render and display that content. </p>
        <li><b>What is elements?</b></li>
        <p>An HTML element is a type of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document component, one of several types of HTML nodes.The first used 
        version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 and there have since been many versions of HTML. The current de facto standard is 
        governed by the industry group WHATWG and is known as the HTML Living Standard.</p>
        <li><b>What is difference b/w html4 & html5?</b></li>
        <p>HTML5 significantly improves upon HTML4 with features like native multimedia support, semantic elements, and modern APIs, making it more
        powerful and easier to use. HTML5 also simplifies the document type declaration and enhances error handling compared to its predecessor.</p>
        <li><b>What are lists?</b></li>
        <p>An HTML List allows you to organize data on web pages into an ordered or unordered format to make the information easier to read and 
        visually appealing. HTML Lists are very helpful for creating structured, accessible content in web development.There are three main types 
        of lists in HTML:
        <ul type="square">
            <li><b>Unordered Lists:</b>These lists are used for items that do not need to be in any specific order. The list items are 
            typically marked with bullets.</li>
            <li><b>Ordered Lists: </b>These lists are used when the order of the items is important. Each item in an ordered list is typically 
            marked with numbers or letters.</li>
            <li><b>Description Lists:</b> These lists are used to contain terms and their corresponding descriptions.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <br>
        <li><b>What is difference b/w XML & HTML?</b></li>
        <ul type="square">
            <li><b>HTML:</b> Primarily used for structuring and displaying content on web pages. Its focus is on how data appears to the user in a 
            browser</li>
            <li><b>XML:</b> Primarily used for storing and transporting data. Its focus is on describing the data itself, not its presentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>What are attritubes still coverup to now?</b></li>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>src</li>
            <li>href</li>
            <li>target</li>
            <li>alt</li>
            <li>style</li>
